This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: attempting to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  The `Bug.js` file illustrates the error; it fetches data asynchronously and uses the data to update the state immediately.  Before the data is fetched, the component renders and tries to access the state, resulting in an error.  The `BugSolution.js` file provides a solution by adding a check to see if the state is initialized before attempting to render any data.  This shows how to handle asynchronous data properly in React Native components.
